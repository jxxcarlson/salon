## Introduction

*Why is there something rather than nothing?* This is the fundamental question, both for physics and philosophy.  To attempt to answer it, we must consider a prior question: what is the something of which we wish to speak?  That is, what is it that makes up chairs and tables, trees and mountains, humans and hummingbirds, stars and galaxies? To pose this question is already to make an assumption: that there is some single stuff of which all things are made. That assumption, and the question based on it, is very old, going back, as far as we know, to the Greek philosophers Democritus and and Leucippus and to the Roman poet Lucretius, author of *De Rerum Natura* (On the Nature of Things).  Their common thesis was that all that we know is made of atoms: tiny unseen and indivisible particles.  The word comes from the Greek *a* (not) and *tomein* (to cut): that which cannot be cut.


## The Atomic Theory

The idea of atoms a long, long history, perhaps the longest of any idea in science. To understand the idea its story, we begin with a thought experiment.  Then we will talk about what it takes to transform an idea from speculation and philosophy to real science.  One answer: perform an actual experiment.

### A Thought Experiment

Let us perform a small thought experiment. We begin with a sugar cube, a solid object about 1cm on a side. Crush it into its constituent crystals.  They are much smaller, about one millimeter on a side. The result is a coarse powder. Doing the math, we find that we have 10 crystals lined up end to end along one edge of the cube, and so 10x10x10 = 1,000 crystals altogether.  


Grind this in a mortar and pestle, breaking each crystal into small pieces.  Let's say that each crystal is broken into 100 pieces.  The sugar cube is now a fine powder of 1,000 x 100 x 100 x 100 = 1,000,000,000 tiny grains â€” a billion of them.  How big are they?  Well, the crystals were little cubes one millimeter on a side, so these grains are one-hundredth of a millimeter long, or 10 microns.  A micron is one millionth of a meter.  By comparison, [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria) range in size from 0.5 to 5.0 microns.  In any case, the grains are so small that we cannot see them with the naked eye, or even a magnifying glass.  A microscope is necessary.  A skeptic might even ask *do those grains you are talking about really exist?  I cannot see them.  You are making assumptions and engaging in wild theorizing.*. The skeptic does have a point, but is question can be answered, since we do have microscopes that can make the grains visible.

Let us go a step further.  We place the powder in a special machine that can break the grains into still finer particles, smashing each once again into 100 pieces.  Now the pieces are a tenth of a micron in size, the size of the very smallest bacteria.  The number of pieces has increased by a factor of 100x100x100 = 1,000,000, so there are now this many: 1,000,000,000,000,000. That is 1 followed by 15 zeros. A lot.  So many that we use scientific notation: 10^15 little pieces.

One can ask, how many times can we repeat this operation, using ever more sophisticated machines?  Can we go on forever, or must we stop at some point?  Is there a stage at which we find atoms, particles that are indivisible, that can be cut no further?  This was the ancient question asked by Leucippus, Democritus, and Lucretius.  The positive response, that there is a limit, an indivisible particle called *atom*  is the fundamantal postulate of the atomic theory of matter.  


### A Real Experiment

For a very long time, the atomic postulate was a subject of philosophical debate, not scientific inquiry.  What does one need to transform philosophy into science?  One answer is an experiment.  An experiment is a kind of cleverly designed question that one puts to nature.  By running the experiment, one forces Nature, who is notoriously coy, to give a clear-cut answer.  Here is an example.  Aristotle (385 BC, bless his heart) believed that objects fall with a speed proportional to their weight and inversely proportional to the density of the medium in which they fall.  While somewhat crude in its mathematical expression, this dictum is in agreement with certain observations.  A stone dropped in water falls more slowly than a stone dropped in air.  A stone dropped in air drops falls more rapidly than a feather. 


As is well known, Galileo (1564-1642) held a different view: that falling objects undergo accelerated motion, so that with each succeeding second, they fall faster than in the second before.  Moreover, he maintained that all bodies, heavy or light, fall in the same way, with the same acceleration of 9.8 meters per second per second. This is perhaps the first and best instance of a definite physical law.  A good law can be used to make predictions.  One of these is that different objects, be they heavy or light, when dropped at the same time from the same height, will reach the ground at the same time.  Galileo is said to have performed such an experiment on the Leaning Tower of Pisa. This is doubtful, but he did perform various thought experiments, as we know from his writings.  Generations of physicists have performed such experiments, and all lead to one conclusion: Aristotle was wrong and Galileo was right.

The experiment is one that we too can perform in our kitchen. Take two objects, one heavy, one light.  I took a spoon and an almond.  Hold one in the right hand, one in the left.  Let go at the same instant and observe what happens.  My results?  They hit the kitchen floor, which is made of tile, at the same instant. The simplicity of this experiment leads one to ask *Why did Aristotle get it wrong?*. He was in many ways the first scientist and was indisputably a great thinker and philosopher.  My own explanation was that experimentation was not part of the Greek mind-set or culture (or anyone else at the time either).  There are other examples of this kind of cultural blindness. Recall Hero's "steam engine," or better yet, the Antikithera mechanism, a mechanical computer for calculating the positions of the sun, moon, and planets.  While the Greeks were capable of engineering genius, such genius never transformed society as it did during the Industrial Revolution.  Perhaps because, with an ample supply of slave labor, transformation had no immediate economic benefit.
